file (0-sum_them_all.c) a function that returns the sum of all its parameters. Prototype: int _sum_them_all(const unsigned int n, ...); if n == 0, return 0.

file (1-print_numbers.c) a function that prints numbers, followed by a new line. Prototype: void print_numbers(const char *seperator, co

nst unsigned int n, ...); where seperator,is the string to the be printed between numbers and n is the number of integers passed to the 

function you are allowed to use printf if seperator is NULL, don't print it Print a new line at the end of your function.               

                                                                                                                                        

file (2-print_strings.c) a function that prints strings, followed by a new line. Prototype: void print_strings(const char *seperator, const unsigned int n, ...); where seperator is the string to be printed between the strings and n is the number of strings passed to the function. You are allowed to use printf if seperator is NULL, don't print it if one of the string is NULL, print (nil) instead print a new line at the end of your function.

file (3-print_all.c) a function that prints anything. Prototype: void print_all(const char * const format, ...); where for mat is a list of types of arguments passed to the function c: char i: integer f: float s: char * (if the string is NULL, print (nil) instead any other char should be ignored see example. You are not allowed to use for, goto, ternary operator, else, do ... hwhile you can use maximum of 2nwhile loops 2 if you can declare a maximum of 9 variables you are allowed to use printf print a new line at the end of your function.
